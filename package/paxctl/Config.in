	  paxctl is a tool that allows PaX flags to be modified on a
	  per-binary basis. It is part of Grsecurity.

	  Grsecurity is a set of patches for hardening the Linux kernel.
	  It provides:

	  - PaX: protection for memory pages.
	  - Role Based Access Control: a mechanism to restrict access to
	    objects (files, sockets, ...) by subjects (processes) based on
	    roles.
	  - and more!

	  This program needs a properly patched and configured kernel to have
	  any effect.
