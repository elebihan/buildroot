	  Administrative interface for the grsecurity Role Based Access
	  Control system.

	  Grsecurity is a set of patches for hardening the Linux kernel.
	  It provides:

	  - PaX: protection for memory pages.
	  - Role Based Access Control: a mechanism to restrict access to
	    objects (files, sockets, ...) by subjects (processes) based on
	    roles.
	  - and more!

	  This package provides gradm, a tool to manage the RBAC policy.

	  If the linux-pam package is selected, PAM authentification support
	  will be added (gradm_pam).

	  Your kernel needs to be properly patched and configured for this
	  program to have any effect.
